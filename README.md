# tunesfix
Reorganizes your music directory tree by album rather than by artist. Powerful, unique tag-editor.

## requirements;
I have included the requisite dlls and resourses in zip-files. Read Readme.txt...
To build both TunesFiX and its MSI installer, set the solution target to "Release" and "x86".
Next, right-click "TunesFiX" and choose "Rebuild" then right-click "TunesFiX Installer" and choose "Rebuild". The output msi installer will go to the ".\TunesFiX Installer\Release" folder.
